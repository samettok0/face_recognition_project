# Face Recognition Biometric Authentication

A modern facial recognition system for biometric authentication using computer vision. This system is designed to provide secure access control through real-time face recognition.

## Overview

This project implements a video-based biometric authentication system that can:
- Register new users by capturing face images
- Authenticate users in real-time using face recognition
- Continuously monitor for authorized faces
- Provide a foundation for integration with physical lock mechanisms

The system focuses on accuracy and performance for secure biometric access control.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Webcam

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-auth.git
   cd face-recognition-auth
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv facerecogenv
   source facerecogenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: facerecogenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Note: Installation of `dlib` may require additional steps on some systems.

## Usage

### Register a New User

Before authentication, you need to register at least one user:

```
python -m src.main register
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to:
- Enter your name
- Capture multiple face images (10 recommended)
- Train the recognition model

### One-time Authentication

To run a single authentication attempt:

```
python -m src.main auth
```

This will activate the camera and attempt to authenticate any face it detects against registered users.

### Continuous Monitoring

For ongoing authentication (e.g., to control access to a secure area):

```
python -m src.main monitor
```

This mode continuously checks for authorized faces and triggers the authentication process when a face is detected.

### Retraining the Model

If you need to update the face recognition model after adding new users:

```
python -m src.main train
```

## Project Structure

- `src/`
  - `biometric_auth.py`: Core authentication functionality
  - `camera_handler.py`: Camera management and frame capture
  - `config.py`: Configuration settings
  - `face_encoder.py`: Face encoding and model training
  - `face_recognizer.py`: Face recognition algorithms
  - `main.py`: Command-line interface
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions

## Improving Recognition Accuracy

If you experience incorrect identifications:

1. **Increase training data**: Capture more images (15-20) during registration
2. **Vary conditions**: Register in different lighting and angles
3. **Adjust threshold**: Modify the recognition threshold in `BiometricAuth` class
4. **Consistent lighting**: Ensure good, consistent lighting during authentication

## Dependencies

- **face_recognition**: Core face recognition library
- **dlib**: Required by face_recognition
- **OpenCV**: For camera handling and image processing
- **numpy**: For numerical operations
- **Pillow**: For image manipulation

## Future Enhancements

- Hardware integration for physical lock control
- Multi-factor authentication
- Liveness detection to prevent spoofing
- Mobile app control
